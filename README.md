## Key Project Instructions:

This project involves developing the application with the following specifications:

**- Object Creation:** Implement factory functions or use object constructors/classes for creating todo items.

**- Todo Item Properties:** Each todo item must include at least the following properties such as title, description, dueDate, and priority. 

**- Categorization:** Enable categorization of todos into different lists. 

**- Default Page:** Designate a default view for the initial page load.

**- Custom Categories:** Incorporate a feature allowing users to create custom categories for organizing their todos.

**- Modular Design:** Structure the application logic across separate modules. 

**- User Interface (UI) Functions:** The UI should facilitate:
- Viewing all categories
- Viewing all todos (in a summarized form) per category
- Displaying detailed views of todos for editing or simple viewing
- Deleting todos

**- Design Inspiration:** Look at popular todo applications like Todoist, Things, and Any.do for design and functionality ideas.

**- Date Management:** Consider using date-fns for handling dates.

**- Data Storage:** Utilize localStorage for persisting todos data. 

## Built With:
